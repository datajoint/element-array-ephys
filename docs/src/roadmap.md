# Roadmap

Incorporation of SpikeInterface into the Array Electrophysiology Element will be
on DataJoint Elements development roadmap. Dr. Loren Frank has led a development
effort of a DataJoint pipeline with SpikeInterface framework and
NeurodataWithoutBorders format integrated
[https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/nwb_datajoint](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/nwb_datajoint).

Future additions to this element will add functionality to support large (> 48
hours) neuropixel recordings via an overlapping segmented processing approach. 

Further development of this Element is community driven. Upon user requests we will
continue adding features to this Element.
