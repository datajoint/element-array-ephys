# Element Array Electrophysiology

This Element features DataJoint schemas for analyzing extracellular array
electrophysiology data acquired with Neuropixels probes and spike sorted using Kilosort
spike sorter. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with
corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a
fully functional pipeline.

The Element is comprised of `probe` and `ephys` schemas. Several `ephys` schemas are
developed to handle various use cases of this pipeline and workflow: 

+ `ephys_acute`: A probe is inserted into a new location during each session. 

+ `ephys_chronic`: A probe is inserted once and used to record across multiple
  sessions. 

+ `ephys_precluster`: A probe is inserted into a new location during each session.
  Pre-clustering steps are performed on the data from each probe prior to Kilosort
  analysis.

+ `ephys_no_curation`: A probe is inserted into a new location during each session and
  Kilosort-triggered clustering is performed without the option to manually curate the
  results.

`ephys` schemas and an explanation of the tables. To get started with building your own
